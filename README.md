# Python-Computer-System

Python is a computer language that most coders have learned, but what if it could be used to make a "miniature OS" of sorts. Well that's what we set out to do.

If you find an issue, fork the repository, fix the issue, and open an issue under the tag "enhancement" detailing what you did and how you did it. I'm not very skilled in coding currently.

Please refer to todo-list.md for tasks if you can't find anything :)

If you figured out how to compile this, please edit this README file to include instructions. I barely understand what compiling IS.
